# hello-world
This is just another hello-world that will probably never getused again. 
I'd really like to be competent at something. 
I can't even read the hello-world guide without getting distracted. 
Bleh. 

Edit:
I am a 28 year old itinerant farm worker (read "homeless)
I really want to get a job that can pay for me to get a middle class life.
I think I'd like doing a lot of autoCAD. 
I can get a job (I think) at a college driving bus while I go to school there. 
I think I'd like to try and get a BDIC in Transportation management. 
Maybe stack civil engeneering credits in there.
Maybe stack some business in there (CPA?) in there.
I think a civil engeneer with an understanding of money would be very valuable.
I should learn how to code. VBA anf python. Then SQL and PHP.
A long way to go.
